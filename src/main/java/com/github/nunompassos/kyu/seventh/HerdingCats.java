/**
 * In this kata, you will be creating a Java Comparator to sort cats by their weight.
 * <p>
 * The Cat class is preloaded for you., and its signature is given below:
 * <p>
 * public class Cat implements Comparable&lt;Cat&gt;<p>
 * {<p>
 *   public String name;<p>
 *   public double weight;<p>
 * <p>
 *   public Cat(String name, double weight);<p>
 * <p>
 *   \@Override<p>
 *   public int compareTo(Cat c);<p>
 * <p>
 *   \@Override<p>
 *   public boolean equals(Object o);<p>
 * }<p>
 * In the tests, an array of cats will be populated, and then sorted using Arrays.sort(). By default, this will sort the cats by their names.
 * Your job is to complete the implementation of CatWeightComparator so that the cats are sorted by weight.
 * <p>
 * You may assume that no two cats have the same name.
 * <p>
 * For more information about Arrays, take a look <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html">here</a>.
 * <p>
 * For more information about Comparable&lt;T&gt;, see <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html">here</a>.
